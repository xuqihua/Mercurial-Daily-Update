#Mercurial-Daily-Update
My CVS soft is Mercurial，SO when I am working on several projects at the same time, I need to pull&update all my repos, So that's the work this shell DO.
Just feel free to use it!

##How
just put your project path to dirs.conf, one path one line.

##For Git
modify update.sh  `hg pull -u` to `git pull` OR something else.
